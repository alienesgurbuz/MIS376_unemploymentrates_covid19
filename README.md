# MIS376_unemploymentrates_covid19
This project shows the distribution of the impact of coronavirus on unemployment on the graphs. Many businesses have had to close due to the coronavirus and are adversely affected by restrictions. At the same time, people find it difficult to find jobs, as employment in job areas is also decreasing. Due to all these, unemployment rates are increasing dramatically. 
I will use these tools in my project;
